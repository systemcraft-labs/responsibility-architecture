**Figure 1. Responsibility Architecture Around Irreversible Actions**

This diagram illustrates how human responsibility is explicitly preserved before,
immediately prior to, and after irreversible actions through Human Acknowledgement,
Decision Intercept, and Decision Trace, centered around a clearly defined
Responsibility Boundary between human judgment and system execution.
