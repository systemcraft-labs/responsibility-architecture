# Core Definitions

## Human Acknowledgement

**Human Acknowledgement** is a mechanism by which a human explicitly recognizes the existence and nature of a decision prior to an irreversible action.  
It does not constitute approval, authorization, or endorsement of the action.  
Its function is limited to recording that a human was consciously aware of the decision context before execution.  
Human Acknowledgement exists to establish the presence of human awareness without introducing control or intervention.

## Decision Intercept

**Decision Intercept** is a mechanism that introduces a minimal confirmation point immediately before an irreversible action is executed.  
It operates at the final moment at which execution can still be intentionally reconsidered.  
Decision Intercept does not permanently block, delay, or override execution, and remains non-coercive by design.  
Its role is to make the moment of responsibility explicit at the boundary between decision and execution.

---

## Decision Trace

**Decision Trace** is a minimal post-execution record indicating that human acknowledgement or confirmation occurred at the time an irreversible action was executed.  
It does not capture decision content, reasoning, or intent.  
Decision Trace exists to preserve evidence of human presence without enabling retrospective control or surveillance.  
Its scope is limited to indicating that responsibility was structurally recognized at execution time.

---

## Responsibility Boundary

**Responsibility Boundary** is the explicit delineation between the point of human judgment and the commencement of system execution.  
Actions occurring prior to this boundary are attributed to human responsibility, while actions beyond the boundary are attributed to system execution.  
The Responsibility Boundary is defined at design time rather than inferred after an incident.  
Its purpose is to prevent ambiguity in responsibility attribution within automated systems.
