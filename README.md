# Responsibility Architecture for Irreversible Actions

A system-level framework for explicitly defining human responsibility in automated execution.

---

## System Definition

**Responsibility Architecture for Irreversible Actions** is a system-level framework that specifies how human responsibility is explicitly defined in relation to irreversible actions within automated or accelerated systems.  
The framework establishes a **Responsibility Boundary** that delineates the point at which human judgment ends and system execution begins, and identifies three minimal mechanisms positioned around that boundary: **Human Acknowledgement**, which records that a decision has been consciously recognized by a human prior to execution; **Decision Intercept**, which introduces a non-coercive confirmation point immediately before an irreversible action is executed; and **Decision Trace**, which preserves a minimal post-execution record indicating that human presence was acknowledged at the time of execution.  
This framework does not impose approval requirements, behavioral control, surveillance, or permanent blocking, and is independent of specific technologies, implementations, or organizational structures.  
Its role is to prevent responsibility from becoming implicitly undefined as execution authority shifts from human actors to automated systems.
